# Prolog
This is the author's first article on data analysis. The analysis is based on research or the work of the university's final project rewritten for this blog. The research is a study on the use of apps, especially the intentions of mobile game users in Indonesia. Although specifically researched through mobile games, this research can broadly accommodate the use of apps or other technologies. Therefore, the author hopes that readers can enjoy the results of these discoveries.

# Note
All research is original by me. Thank's !
